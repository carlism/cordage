Dear Mr. Doe:

It is with both regret and anticipation that I submit this letter of resignation,
effective January 19, 2011.

I have accepted a position with CDE Company, as an opportunity to further my current
career goals and achieve growth within a supervisory role.

It has been a genuine pleasure working for ABC Company during these past four years.
I have enjoyed working with the fine staff of professionals, and I will miss my
associations here. I wish you and ABC Company continued success in all your endeavors.

If I may be of any assistance in the hiring process or training of my replacement,
please know that I will gladly make myself available to this effort during the
next four weeks.

Sincerely:
